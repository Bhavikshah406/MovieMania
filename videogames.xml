<item><title>Has-Been Heroes Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/has-been-heroes-review/1900-6416651/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>When it was first unveiled, roguelike Has-Been Heroes had unique expectations to meet--here was another game from Frozenbyte, developers of the Trine series, in which you control three heroes at once. But while their previous trios worked together well, this game’s eponymous heroes fall short. At the beginning of the game, the bland triumvirate--made up of two veterans pulled out of retirement and a newcomer, not that it matters--sets out on an uninspired quest to deliver two princesses to school on orders of the king. The plot aims for amusing whimsy, but it doesn’t land, so from the first cutscene on, Has-Been Heroes has a motivation problem. Progress is measured in inches across hours of playtime, with your victories coming more from luck than any discernible decision you made.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437863" data-src="/videos/fighting-off-a-skeleton-army-has-been-heroes-gamep/2300-6437863/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437863/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">You’re given control of three heroes--a mage, a rogue, and a warrior--and sent on a series of brief journeys likely to result in death more often than not. Gameplay boils down to a mix of combat and pathfinding: You progress along a map in the bottom right of the screen, choosing between different forks in the road to determine which nodes along the way you will or won’t access. You try to guess the best path forward, one in which, in between battles, you’ll encounter spell and item vendors who’ll boost your stats or abilities in exchange for the gold you’ve collected from fallen enemies. Odds are, though, that you’ll find yourself growing increasingly frustrated that none of the chests or vendors you encounter are giving you useful spells or equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">The unique battle system places your three heroes along lanes, with enemies coming at you from the right of the screen. The goal is to chip away at the stamina of whichever enemy is leading the charge in the lane by trying to match it with the number of attacks your heroes have. The rogue, for instance, hits three times, so if you smack an enemy with three stamina points, it’ll be stunned and vulnerable. After an attack, your heroes can switch lanes--put the warrior in the same lane and have him attack next, and you can inflict massive damage.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3216399-hasbeenheroes4.png" data-ref-id="1300-3216399" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3216399-hasbeenheroes4.png"><img alt="You'll need to put in a lot of time, and get very lucky, before you earn attacks that look remotely like this." src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3216399-hasbeenheroes4.png" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3216399-hasbeenheroes4.png 1920w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3216399-hasbeenheroes4.png 1280w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3216399-hasbeenheroes4.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>You'll need to put in a lot of time, and get very lucky, before you earn attacks that look remotely like this.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">When you get into a good pattern, and fortune favors you, switching lanes and throwing down your most punishing spells can be exciting. But once you reach each area’s boss, tactical forethought won’t be enough. Getting ahead in these battles eventually requires a good loadout, but whether you’re well equipped by the end of a zone is dependent entirely on luck. You can’t tell what a node is going to contain until you’re adjacent to it. Acquiring items and spells is a gamble--if you haven’t encountered your prize previously in the game, you can’t tell what it does until you have one of your heroes pick it up (and if it’s a bad fit for them, you can’t transfer it to someone else), while many of the vendors ask for coins and then award your chosen character a power without letting you know what it is first. Worse still, often you need to play what’s essentially three-card Monte with treasure chests, knowing that only one of them contains a prize.</p><p dir="ltr">This means that when you die, it’s hard to pinpoint anything you personally did wrong, beyond making a bad choice that you couldn’t have possibly known was bad before you made it. Has-Been Heroes can be exceptionally hard, with an uneven difficulty curve that ramps up too dramatically during boss fights, and if you don’t have the tools capable of holding off their attacks, all you can do is chip away until your inevitable death. When that happens, you’ll have to start again, battling screen after screen of identical skeleton foes that weren’t particularly exciting the first time around, let alone the 30th.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3216397-hasbeenheroes3.png" data-ref-id="1300-3216397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3216397-hasbeenheroes3.png"><img alt="These vendors make you gamble on the possibility of winning an upgrade, which feels unfair when they're so necessary." src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3216397-hasbeenheroes3.png" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3216397-hasbeenheroes3.png 1920w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3216397-hasbeenheroes3.png 1280w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3216397-hasbeenheroes3.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>These vendors make you gamble on the possibility of winning an upgrade, which feels unfair when they're so necessary.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">If you manage to reach the end, you’ll unlock a new hero in one of the three classes. For the first hero, you only need to beat two bosses, but that takes at least four hours. To get the next hero, you need to defeat three bosses, and so on. Unlocking heroes is the only goal to work toward in the game, but the fact that it becomes more and more of a hassle after each victory--and that your reward is an even harder game--sours the experience. This is a shame, because the core combat mechanics of Has-Been Heroes can be quite engaging. Getting to a point where I could consistently defeat the first boss felt good, but never so much so that it made up for the intense grind the game subjected me to.</p><p dir="ltr">Has-Been Heroes is, at least, a great fit for the Switch. It’s the sort of game you can play while half-watching a sitcom in the background, rather than one to which you’ll want to give your full attention. By the same token, playing the game with intense focus starts to feel like a waste of time after the first few hours. It’s a demanding game that gives very little back for the time and effort it eats up. The game’s name does not lie--it’s best to let these has-beens be.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 19:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416651</guid><dc:creator>James O'Connor</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/172/1720905/3216392-has-been-heroes-review-thumb-nologo.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Yooka-Laylee Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/yooka-laylee-review/1900-6416649/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">As a spiritual successor to 3D platformer Banjo-Kazooie, Yooka-Laylee really does capture the cheeky personality of its predecessor. It doesn’t introduce many new ideas, but it does rework the existing formula, creating a far less linear version of the N64 collectathon. Ultimately, though, bloated levels and a largely uncooperative camera keep Yooka-Laylee from being more than just a nostalgia trip.</p><p dir="ltr">The adventure begins when corporate president Capital B steals a book’s golden pages, called Pagies, from a lizard and bat named Yooka and Laylee. The pair figure that the Pagies must be valuable if someone would bother to steal them, so of course they decide to enter Capital B’s building to get them back. That hub area, Hivory Towers, splits into five themed worlds with a variety of collectibles to find, including Pagies, currency-like Quills, and powerups.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437409" data-src="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/yooka-laylee-starting-your-adventure-gameplay/2300-6437409/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437409/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">Yooka-Laylee is about finding collectibles first and foremost, and platforming takes somewhat of a backseat. You can find Quills out in the open, and you unlock Pagies by completing a variety of tasks, from solving simple puzzles to playing a round of golf to, of course, platforming. The focus on a wide range of activities instead of just platforming is actually a good thing, because the camera has a nasty habit of getting in your way when you're exploring levels. It locks into place at seemingly random points and even swings wildly in tough spots, making the platforming challenges that are there terribly frustrating and time-consuming. When most of your time goes toward the collectibles that are the least fun to get, that’s a problem. Once I unlocked the ability to fly for limited periods of time, I started cheating to completely get around tricky platforming sections. However, it’s worth noting that swimming doesn’t suck in Yooka-Laylee, and I didn’t dread underwater sections the way I do in Banjo-Kazooie. Movement in water is quick and easy, so exploring in and around water isn’t a chore.</p><p dir="ltr">I most consistently enjoyed the hub world, where the powerup collectibles are hidden in clever spots and the Pagies are locked behind challenging puzzles that make good use of the moves and techniques you pick up in the discrete worlds. Those worlds also have their strong puzzles, but they’re less consistent.</p><p dir="ltr">There are only five levels, none of which have a terribly original theme. The first world is “tribal”-themed, for example, which was also the case in both Banjo-Kazooie and -Tooie. The casino level is the weakest of the five; it introduces a new kind of collectible that can be exchanged for Pagies, adding an unnecessary layer to the collecting process. But the rest of the levels lay out their collectibles well, and finding all 200 Quills in a level always gave me a sense of pride.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216005-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.18.21+pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-3216005" data-ratio="0.56197771587744" data-width="1436" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1436px"><a href="https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216005-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.18.21+pm.png"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3216005-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.18.21+pm.png" srcset="https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216005-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.18.21+pm.png 1436w, https://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3216005-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.18.21+pm.png 1280w, https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3216005-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.18.21+pm.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216006-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.11+pm.png,https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216007-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.30+pm.png,https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216008-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.21.44+pm.png,https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216009-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.20.05+pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-3216006,1300-3216007,1300-3216008,1300-3216009" data-resize-urls="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216006-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.11+pm.png,https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216007-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.30+pm.png,https://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216008-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.21.44+pm.png,https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216009-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.20.05+pm.png"><a href="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216006-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.11+pm.png"><img src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216006-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.11+pm.png" alt="Gallery image 1" data-full-srcset="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216006-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.11+pm.png 1434w, https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3216006-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.11+pm.png 1280w, https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3216006-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.11+pm.png 480w"></a><a href="https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216007-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.30+pm.png"><img src="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216007-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.30+pm.png" alt="Gallery image 2" data-full-srcset="https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216007-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.30+pm.png 1433w, https://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3216007-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.30+pm.png 1280w, https://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3216007-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.19.30+pm.png 480w"></a><a href="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216008-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.21.44+pm.png"><img src="https://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216008-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.21.44+pm.png" alt="Gallery image 3" data-full-srcset="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216008-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.21.44+pm.png 1430w, https://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3216008-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.21.44+pm.png 1280w, https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3216008-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.21.44+pm.png 480w"></a><a href="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216009-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.20.05+pm.png"><img src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1575/15759911/3216009-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.20.05+pm.png" alt="Gallery image 4" data-full-srcset="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3216009-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.20.05+pm.png 1438w, https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1575/15759911/3216009-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.20.05+pm.png 1280w, https://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3216009-screen+shot+2017-04-03+at+6.20.05+pm.png 480w"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">In contrast to the established Banjo formula, each of the levels can be expanded once, and you can visit each of them in pretty much any order you want. That open structure allows you to control the pace of the adventure since you don’t have to stay stuck on a Pagie or puzzle--you can move on to another world where you might learn a move or strategy that will help you elsewhere. That also makes returning to a world you’ve already visited more rewarding. When you’ve found 20 of the 25 Pagies in a world and are <em>sure</em> there was nothing else you could possibly do to find the rest, coming back to that area with fresh eyes and seeing what you didn’t before is its own special kind of achievement.</p><p dir="ltr">The other update to the Banjo formula--being able to expand worlds--is less successful. Each of the base worlds is clearly incomplete, but expanding them doesn’t necessarily improve them. Because most of them have additions in multiple areas and directions, their layouts are hard to follow, and just figuring out where you haven’t been yet can be tedious. They’re hard to parse in the same way that N64-era levels were because they’re open-ish but sectioned off in unnatural places with no landmarks or visual aid to guide you. The snow level in particular is broken up into a bunch of areas that connect in bizarre ways, and even after several hours exploring it, I’m not entirely sure which caves connect to which parts.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like the level design itself, the boss fights in each world feel stale and outdated. Each boss up through the end of the game follows a very simple structure: you figure out their attack strategy, hit them a couple times until they change up that strategy, and repeat maybe three times until they’re dead. But since you don’t need all the Pagies to actually beat the game, these bosses are as optional as any other individual Pagie.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Coming back to a level with fresh eyes and seeing what you didn’t before is its own special kind of achievement.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">20 hours of hunting collectibles and fighting simple bosses later, I had found the bare minimum amount of Pagies necessary to move on to the end of the game and couldn’t justify finding any more than that. The ones I hadn’t yet collected were not worth either the time it would take or the frustration I’d have to endure to get them.</p><p dir="ltr">I stayed as long as I did because of my own nostalgia. Although there aren’t references outright, Yooka-Laylee has plenty of Banjo parallels. The lizard-and-bat duo are nearly identical in personality to Banjo and Kazooie, with Laylee making the majority of the snarky comments and Yooka being the voice of reason. On top of that, the collectibles and moves are very similar in function to their counterparts in the Banjo games, and the music features many of the same familiar motifs. But Yooka-Laylee also lacks new ideas, and the twists it introduces aren’t entirely successful.</p><p>Ultimately, Yooka-Laylee’s best and worst aspects come directly from its predecessor. Despite attempts at modernizing the formula, its style of gameplay is still outdated, and it doesn’t stay challenging or interesting for long as a result. But if you’re looking for a faithful return to the Banjo-Kazooie formula, Yooka-Laylee certainly delivers--from the font to the music to the wealth of collectibles, it’s worthy of the title of spiritual successor.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416649</guid><dc:creator>Kallie Plagge</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1575/15759911/3216010-yooka-laylee-review-thumb-nologo.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Parappa The Rapper Remastered Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/parappa-the-rapper-remastered-review/1900-6416650/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>You can pretty much count the number of PlayStation games from 1996 that actually stand the test of time on a single hand, but Parappa the Rapper is a particularly egregious example of a game that had a deep problem even back then: it's a rhythm game that can't keep rhythm.</p><p dir="ltr">At their worst, broken games are a valuable lesson in what not to do. But at their best, you get games that overcome major technical shortcomings to deliver exceptional experiences despite their flaws. Parappa the Rapper is almost--almost--in that latter category. After all, it's difficult to put down a game about a rapping dog trying to win the affection of an anthropomorphic sunflower by learning karate from a giant onion, getting his driver's license from a moose, and nearly screwing up his date with her because he can't find a toilet to pee in.</p><p dir="ltr">While Parappa and the world he inhabits are amusing, the game he stars in is frustrating to play. The foundation of the game is a call-and-response system: in each stage Parappa is paired with a wacky character with some wisdom to impart via the power of hip-hop. The stage master will drop a silly, nonsense rhyme, each syllable of which corresponds to a timed button press on the controller. You need to copy the pattern and respond with a rhyme of your own.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6438035"

Trying to match button presses exactly with what you see on screen will result in failure. What ultimately works is hitting the syllables in some invisible sweet spot that seems to be unique to each master, which means gameplay feels more predicated on luck than rhythm. Regardless, even when Parappa's rhymes do play out on time, he sounds like a dying Siri.</p><p dir="ltr">The kicker is that the game has an Easy mode that eases the odd and strict timing for each note, but--in another one of those touches that could only have come from the mid-’90s--only the first three stages of the game are playable when you knock the difficulty down, and your scores aren't saved. Oddly, the game's original cutscenes remain untouched--they're presented in tiny boxes, in their original low-res form.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an awful rhythm game. All the more awful because I was compelled to continue playing despite its obvious flaws.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its issues, Parappa the Rapper has an infectious spirit. Its bright and unmistakable aesthetic lends the game an undeniable charm, especially since the remaster smooths out the original's jagged pixels. The tonal weirdness makes its craziest moments unforgettable. The raps are Sesame Street levels of rudimentary yet silly enough to be memorable, and the constant repetition of failing and retrying stages hammers them into your brain like musical nails.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6438037" data-src="/videos/parappa-the-rapper-remastered-making-money-with-pr/2300-6438037/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6438037/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">The linchpin is the game’s attitude. Parappa himself is a loser with no money or prospects who spends his entire day hanging out with his loser friends. He's also constantly being shown up by the very rich and very lame Joe Chin, who shows up in every cutscene to demonstrate how much better he is. And yet, every time the chips are down, Parappa springs up, screams “I gotta believe!” and does something crazy to match Joe with the sheer size of his heart. Parappa is the G-rated version of <em>8 Mile’s</em> B-Rabbit, and his willingness to overcome every obstacle in his silly life with the power of belief is so charming, it's easy to forget you're getting torn apart on the scoreboard.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a generation of gamers who will find Parappa the Rapper Remastered validates all their happiest memories watching Parappa kicking and spinning with Chop Chop Master Onion again, more vibrant and colorful than ever before. But there will come a point when they have to confront how incongruous the aggravating gameplay is with how delightful everything else around it is. The aesthetics and vibe are still unlike anything else out there, and they’re still worth the hassle. But the greatest trick Parappa the Rapper ever pulled was convincing the world it's not a broken game.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 21:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416650</guid><dc:creator>Justin Clark</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/3216015-8971768113-PaRap.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Rain World Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rain-world-review/1900-6416648/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Rain World effectively illustrates the cruel indifference of nature. As a half-rabbit, half-slug creature trying to reunite with its family, you start smack dab in an unfamiliar land with an ecosystem where you're both predator and prey. Rain is a threat to your survival, but it pales in comparison to the game's many hunters and, unfortunately, unforgiving environments.</p><p dir="ltr">Rain is to blame for the rabbit-slug's isolation to begin with. As the opening cutscenes illustrate, the storms are what separated the poor creature from its family. The resulting quest to reunite with its loved ones is a long and arduous 2D trek that challenges you with limited resources and abilities. Your most useful skills are the ones you start with, namely a good throwing arm and a long jump. Ultimately, these are all you need to reach Rain World's end, though the game's pervasive threats made me crave more skills. If you get caught in the rain, you die. The only way you can survive is if you manage to reach one of the game's many waterproof shelters.</p><p>Once you reach a shelter, however, you're forced into hibernation, and surviving the long sleep requires consuming a minimum of four food items, be it flies or fruit. A screen's worth of fruit or flies--assuming there are some available--often provides the food you need but it takes a few hibernation periods to replenish. As a result, you're often compelled to explore beyond your comfort zone for other food sources.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437865" data-src="/videos/exploring-a-wasteland-rain-world-gameplay/2300-6437865/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437865/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Comfort is a relative term in Rain World. You can commit a region's layout and myriad paths to memory, but you're still vulnerable to many merciless predators. Their locations on the map change every time you emerge from slumber. This typically sustains a moderate level of freshness in each play session, though it's not uncommon to find yourself in punishing and unfair situations. Some creatures--like the giant vultures--appear with little to no warning. And if your timing is unlucky, a vicious lizard can be waiting for you at the edge of the next screen, leaving you with no opportunity to react, let alone escape. In a game that forces you to mentally juggle numerous variables to survive, these unpreventable deaths can feel exceedingly frustrating.</p><p dir="ltr">If you do manage to create distance between you and a lizard, the ensuing chase can be hampered by platforming issues. Rain World's tutorial offers minimal instruction and learning how to interact with the environment can be vexing. A seemingly simple act like jumping off a bridge to grab a metal rod jutting from the concrete should be easy. Instead, you're forced to move with the finesse of a trapeze artist, the feeling of which is at odds with the urgency of escaping a pursuer you have no chance of defeating.</p><figure

enjoyment. Aside from the demands of reaching shelter with enough food in your belly, forward progress is impeded by gates between each region. Passing those gates requires maintaining a positive win-loss record--in other words, your hibernation frequency has to be higher than your death rate; a seeming bizarre and arbitrary requirement. Given all the game's other demands, this method of proving your worthiness feels harsh and nonsensical in practice. Having to forage and hibernate for the sole purpose of passing a gate feels disrespectful of the player's time since there are no other rewards for killing and eating.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, there's a heightened sense of relief in reaching a new region. As you explore each new area, you're hit with a renewed feeling of resignation and acceptance of the many deaths you'll soon rack up as you reach dead ends and find the mainline path to the next gate. In an unfair process of trial and error, you make leaps of faith off cliffs to test whether falling beyond the bottom of the screen means your death or the discovery of a new area. And when you find a new gate, the tiresome process of hibernating for the privilege of passing that gate begins anew.</p><p dir="ltr">The silver lining of forward progress is that you're continually treated to the unique and striking visuals of Rain World's ruined landscape. The surreal creature designs, combined with the lack of humans makes this world feel both eerily lonely and alien. It carries the same imaginative spirit of games like Bioshock and Abzu, where you're too preoccupied admiring the artistry to question the logistics of how these man made environments were constructed within the fiction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1484/14849348/3214900-0017.png" data-ref-id="1300-3214900"

see glimmers of excellence. There are a handful of satisfying moments of exercising ingenuity when you're using your environment and limited resources to your advantage. You can lure two predators into the same area, and the resulting fight between the two will give you an opportunity for a discrete escape. A stick is primarily intended to stun predators, but it's also useful as a climbing point if you throw it against a wall. Rain World shines during the rare moments that encourage improvisation, like when you grab and haul a glowing mouse-like creature against its will so you can use its body to illuminate an otherwise pitch black area.</p><p>In Rain World, the spectre of failure, often caused by events you can't control, lingers heavily. It quickly drives home the point that you're a foreigner in a ruined land where anyone larger than you wants to eat you. Its stunningly detailed backgrounds and few rewarding gameplay opportunities are vastly outweighed by its platforming imperfections and hibernation mechanic, which makes little sense in its connection to accessing new areas. Oftentimes, the frustrations resulting from failure devolve into apathy, which is a wholly unfortunate outcome for a game that gives off a deceptively promising first impression.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2017 19:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416648</guid><dc:creator>Miguel Concepcion</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1484/14849348/3214912-rain-world-review-promo.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>

The third episode of the New Frontier makes great narrative strides, but it runs too much on autopilot along the way. While the story itself is satisfying to watch--especially in how it ups the stakes for protagonist Javi Garcia--this is one of those Walking Dead episodes that’s much more of an interactive movie than an adventure game.</p><p dir="ltr">Like this season's first episode, Above the Law kicks things off with a flashback. This brief look into the past helps establish the leading foursome as something of an alternative family unit for the zombie apocalypse. It’s also oddly hopeful in contrast with the present, which is full of hardships and unexpected curveballs.</p><p dir="ltr">The themes about the importance of family ties in a world where nobody can be trusted aren’t exactly subtle here, but they work, thanks mainly to the advancement of the relationship brewing between Javi and Kate. Now that their predictable mutual attraction is finally addressed, we get to see the group dynamic shift in meaningful ways.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437893" data-src="/videos/the-walking-dead-a-new-frontier-ep-3-above-the-law/2300-6437893/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437893/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">Seeing these events transpire is gratifying, despite feeling overly predictable. Richmond is exactly the cesspool it appears to be. Clementine returns at the most opportune moment and is every bit the pint-sized badass she was last time out. David is a serial abuser and blowhard practically begging you to steal his wife. Jesus is wise and cool. Tripp is gruff but lovable. And, yes, Above the Law features speeches from corrupt people about how you have to do whatever it takes to survive in a world where the dead walk around and eat people.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the above is Walking Dead 101. Nobody will be surprised that those elements are big parts of this episode. Nonetheless, the superb quality of the script, voice acting, and animation (which is smoother and more lifelike than in previous episodes, with no jarring jerks or hiccups that have been relatively common in the past) makes everything compelling to watch even though you get the sense that the story is pretty blatantly maneuvering everyone into place.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">The lack of meaningful choices proves to be the bigger sin--you might as well get some popcorn out for the first 45 minutes or so of Above the Law.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">The lack of meaningful choices proves to be the bigger sin--you might as well get some popcorn out for the first 45 minutes or so of Above the Law. It’s easy to forget you’re doing anything but watching an animated movie...and then you wind up getting killed when zombies show up after the midpoint and you’re sitting back from the keyboard or with the gamepad in your lap as a spectator. A fair number of dialogue options appear in the early stages of the episode, but none of them seem to really impact the direction of the story. Most result in typical Telltale feedback like “Kate will remember that” and have no immediate effect on other characters.</p><p dir="ltr">The action heats up toward the end of the episode when the truth about Richmond’s leadership is revealed through a nod back to what happened to Prescott in Episode 2. Also, a handful of challenging battles with humans and zombies require multiple clicks of keys in order to avoid a chomp or shot in the face. Although the surprise of having to twitch-click your way through battles is tough to handle at first, given the lightweight first two-thirds of the game, nothing here provides any serious obstacles.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery"

the game if you're familiar with the TV show. Instead of something original and natural, you get a forced (and all too familiar) scene that immediately recalls a series-famous trope. As a result, the scene is more derivative than shocking (although you’ll still need a strong stomach to endure the entire thing--at least if you go for the most extreme final stroke.)</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, bring on Episode 4. As much as Above the Law advances A New Frontier’s narrative and sets up what will inevitably be a chaotic battle for Richmond, there just isn’t enough to do this time around. Telltale’s Walking Dead series always treads the line between interactive fiction and adventure game, but here the whole production tips over the edge to the point where you feel like you’re watching a movie. Granted, it’s a pretty good movie. It’s filled with realistic characters, intense scenes, and some of the most brutal violence depicted in the franchise thus far. But it’s essentially a movie nonetheless, with too many compromises made to manipulate the plot and characters into position for the upcoming finale.</p><p> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2017 16:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416647</guid><dc:creator>Brett Todd</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/3214832-1789366920-307652154450977" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Snake Pass Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/snake-pass-review/1900-6416646/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Playing a 3D platformer without a jump button is a strange experience. When I first started <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/snake-pass/">Snake Pass</a>, I felt lost without the warm blanket of a double jump. How do I get to that floating platform across the chasm? How am I supposed to change direction after I screw up my initial movement? And just <em>how</em> am I to obtain that arbitrary hard-to-reach shiny collectible?!</p><p dir="ltr">Answering these questions is easy once you realize that Snake Pass requires you to not only move like a snake, but <em>think</em> like a snake. Initially, I struggled to adapt to my lack of legs (I've grown quite attached to my limbs, you see): falling from the top of high peaks, slithering straight off rocky cliffs, and slamming into walls were sights seen far too often--making much of the mid-game more frustrating than enjoyable. But somehow, things clicked, and slinking up a pole to reach an objective became a natural and strangely beautiful movement, and one that distinguishes Snake Pass as a platformer like no other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1556/15568848/3214784-31-03-2017_17-34-12.png" data-ref-id="1300-3214784"

Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/yooka-laylee/">Yooka-Laylee</a>, Snake Pass has clearly been inspired by late 90s platformers such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/banjo-kazooie/">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, but rather than simply retread what has come before, its central mechanic aims to innovate. Unfortunately, while Noodle and Doodle have cute names and appear full of character, their voices and personalities--or lack thereof--don't quite have the charm of the aforementioned Rare mascots or other popular mascot creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">The joy, then, must come from Snake Pass's mechanics. Make no mistake, this is a game about momentum, and about 'feel;' about how well developer Sumo Digital can translate being a serpent onto a gamepad. Initially, this is taught well, with easier obstacles and smaller enclosures allowing you to get to grips with your new boa constrictor body. You're afforded the time and a safe environment to learn how to wrap your body around poles, how to accelerate across flat ground (you actually have to move side-to-side), and how to successfully climb upwards. Unfortunately, the mid-game's difficulty curve is steep. There are no enemies in Snake Pass, but each of the game's four main worlds introduces new fatal, obstacles; ravines, spikes, lava, and more stand between you and three keystones, which you need to collect to open the exit portal in each level. At this stage, you're still acclimatizing to life on no feet, and yet Snake Pass expects you to run before you can wriggle.</p><p dir="ltr">There are other problems, too. Your airborne friend Doodle is supposed to be able to pick up your tail end to give you an upwards boost, but he'll frequently refuse to help when called upon. I now have a mild hatred towards hummingbirds as a result.</p><p dir="ltr">The camera's positioning is also an issue, as it often picks the wrong angle to show you as you're attempting to curl yourself around the next piece of connective bamboo. Far too often you'll need to manually move your viewpoint, and combined with the separate buttons for forward movement, lateral movement, vertical movement, and gripping, all of which are frequently being pushed at the same time, it can feel like you're tying yourself in a knot.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437842" data-src="/videos/snake-charmers-lets-play-snake-pass/2300-6437842/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437842/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">However, when your serpentine abilities catch up with the difficulty curve a little further in, Snake Pass transforms. You learn which movements to pull off to stay wrapped around a peg--when to tighten your muscles, when to lift your head up, and when to realize the game is up and it's best to skip to the next moving platform. As you improve, the momentum you build in gliding up and over obstacles can lead to some wonderful sights--there's something instinctively satisfying about seeing a snake's tail chase after its head, especially knowing you were the choreographer. And that's helped by the vibrant character and environment art, the latter of which accentuates each world's natural beauty, while the changing color palettes make each level appear distinct from the last. This is a game whose sense of motion is palpable, with platforms whizzing by and moving reptilian stripes attracting the eye--and yet I often found myself gazing at a distant treeline or glowing collectible orb. Maybe I wouldn't have died so much if I'd been paying attention...</p><p dir="ltr">Snake Pass's artistry extends into its soundtrack. Each track fits its world perfectly--ramping up tension when necessary--but mostly the panpipes and steel drums add to the exotic peace already hinted at by the game's appearance. It meant that even in that difficult middle period, even when I was frustrated at having died at the same obstacle for the fifth time, I rarely wanted to chuck my controller out the window.</p><p dir="ltr">At times, then, Snake Pass can be a wonderfully relaxing journey through some beautiful habitats. The late game switches into an engaging and challenging puzzler, requiring some deft flicks of the left stick, but one that can feel immensely gratifying when you elegantly slalom your way over a narrow assault course that's suspended over lava. It's the middle third, when the game expects too much of you far too soon, that causes the momentum to stutter. Nevertheless, Snake Pass is a quirky puzzler that innovates while simultaneously evoking memories of your favourite platformers of yesteryear--just don't expect to grow into your new skin overnight.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2017 13:47:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416646</guid><dc:creator>Oscar Dayus</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1556/15568848/3214763-1492959822-304909729315494" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>MLB The Show 17 Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-17-review/1900-6416645/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Hitting a baseball might be the hardest thing to do in professional sports. It's a feat not just reliant on athletic ability, but on skill, patience, and finely tuned mechanics. MLB The Show 17 revels in this fact, making each line drive and moonshot feel immanently special. From the emphatic crack of the bat as the ball is sent careening through the air, to the way the crowd rises to their feet with oohs and aahs in equal parts awe and rabid excitement.</p><p dir="ltr">Batting in Sony's long-running series has never been better. Previously, the series' ball physics were modelled on a baseball hitting a flat surface, which resulted in the ball taking relatively straight flight paths with minimal spin. I never considered this to be a facet of the game in urgent need of improvement, but now that the physics are based on the trajectory of a ball colliding off of a round bat, the leap in quality is unmistakable. Not only does this enhancement inject a dose of added realism, but it also increases the variety of dynamic hits you're likely to see. You'll witness balls sliced down the third base line that spin just enough to stay fair, bloops that fall between the second basemen and right fielder, and topspin line drives that soar over the center fielder's head before crashing into an outfield wall. I can't count the amount of times I've paused the game after a scorching double, just to hop into a replay and savour the ball's flight path. The physics are really that good.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

outmatched, however--far from it. Those patrolling the diamond are more intelligent than ever thanks to The Show 17's Humanity AI. You'll never have to worry about a runner being called safe because your shortstop took his sweet time throwing to first base. Now the AI is smart enough to discern between a speed merchant like Billy Hamilton bursting down the line and the lumbering stride of someone like Miguel Cabrera, and can adapt their level of urgency appropriately. They're going to rush throws for those bang-bang plays at first, and take their time when they know they can; banishing the frustration inherent in the lackadaisical fielding that plagued previous entries in the series, while still maintaining The Show's authenticity. A deluge of fluid, new animations tie all of this together. And while the excellent pitching mechanics remain seemingly unchanged, I do appreciate the visible torque apparent in the game's pitching animations. It's a small detail, but one that edges the presentation closer to reality.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, intelligence inside the dugout aren't quite matched by the brains out on the field. AI Managers still aren't great at handling their pitching staff. I've encountered a few instances where relievers have been left to the wolves, long after they should have been pulled from the mound. The most egregious of these occurred when a reliever was summoned into the game, only to give up 11 earned runs on an unbelievable 136 pitches, before his skipper finally decided he had seen enough. I just felt sorry for the poor guy.</p><p dir="ltr">The immensely popular career mode Road to the Show returns and is as engrossing as ever. You can still import a character from last year's game to continue where you left off, or start from scratch to guide a young upstart from the fairgrounds of the minor leagues to the 30,000 capacity ballparks on the big stage. In an attempt to breathe some fresh air into the mode, Sony have incorporated a narrative overlay in this year's game, dubbed "Pave Your Path." It's not as substantial or captivating as the story modes found in the NBA2K series or FIFA 17's "The Journey," but it does add some flavour to what was previously a fairly by-the-numbers affair.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437667" data-src="/videos/playing-a-full-game-in-mlb-the-show-17/2300-6437667/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437667/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">Told in a documentary style--think HBO's Hard Knocks--with each scene described by a narrator, you can choose from a range of dialogue options in various baseball-related situations. It's not a robust system, essentially boiling down to whether you want to be humble or arrogant, and do what you think is best for the team or yourself. There are potential repercussions if you continue to disrespect your organisation and its staff, as you're liable to find yourself on the trading block. But the vast majority of interactions offer little more than an opportunity to role-play and shape the personality of your created player, and it doesn't take long before scenes begin to repeat either.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few big moments sprinkled throughout that have more far-reaching consequences, such as interacting with your new team's owner after the draft, or being asked to play another position. I decided to create a shortstop in my career, and after a measly showing in the draft showcase, I was picked in one of the latter rounds by the Milwaukee Brewers. After crushing it for the first couple of months, my Double-A manager invited me into his office and asked if I wanted to try playing third base for ten games or so. I would get a chance to gain some valuable experience in a new position, and if it worked out, my versatility would give the team more options going forward. So I agreed.</p><p dir="ltr">Once those ten games had passed, I was called back into the manager's office and informed that the team wanted to keep me at third base for the foreseeable future. I had played exceptionally good defence in the hot corner, and with Jonathan Villar fully entrenched at shortstop on the major league roster, and a top 50 prospect also manning the position in the minors, it made sense that my best path to the majors would go through another position on the field. It doesn't always work this cleanly--with a created pitcher, my demotion to the bullpen was more contrived than believable--but when the stars align and the trajectory of your career naturally deviates, it makes "Pave Your Path" a worthwhile addition to the Road to the Show formula.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery"

Traditionally, playing a full 162-game season can be a laborious grind if you're not simply skimming your way through a vast majority of the games. Now there are a few more options on a game-by-game basis if you want to expedite the process and still feel involved. You can still play or manage a full game, or you can cut down the time of games by more than half by selecting quick manage or player lock. The former speeds through games at a rapid pace while still giving you a say in every single at-bat. And, if you want, you can jump in and out at any time and take direct control, even if it's only for one crucial at-bat or two. Meanwhile, player lock lets you play an entire game as a single player, à la Road to the Show. So if you've always just wanted to be Bryce Harper, now you can. These are smart new additions that ensure you can have a palpable impact on all 162-games in a season, no matter how much or how little you actually play.</p><p dir="ltr">After card collecting game Diamond Dynasty received a total revamp last year, it returns intact with 30 more legendary players added. So if you've ever wanted to trot out an outfield of Ken Griffey Jr., Ted Williams, and Mike Trout, now you can (provided you're incredibly lucky/willing to spend some cash). And with Griffey emblazoned on the cover, MLB The Show 17 invites some nostalgia with the new Retro mode. With its 8-bit filter and arcade-style one-button mechanics, it invokes old-school classics like R.B.I. Baseball on the NES. It's a fun novelty, but since it's limited to single games, it feels like a missed opportunity without the ability to play a full season.</p><p>MLB The Show 17 continues the series' fantastic tradition of consistency and refinement. Improvements to its various game modes give you more ways to play the game how you want to, and the action on the field has never been better, with smarter fielding AI, and enhanced ball physics that bring the hitting to life. Commentary is still a little too stilted for my liking, and there are other blemishes lurking throughout. But when you connect with a fastball and send the ball spiralling into a gap in center field, any issues retreat to the back of your mind. This is America's National Pastime at its best.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2017 13:31:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416645</guid><dc:creator>Richard Wakeling</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/3214579-2623205569-MLBTh.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Flatout 4: Total Insanity Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/flatout-4-total-insanity-review/1900-6416644/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>For a game with the words "Total Insanity" in its title, it’s fair to expect a certain level of madness around every corner. The Flatout series' cornerstone has always been chaos on the racetrack and Total Insanity certainly is chaotic. Being Kylotonn Games’ first Flatout, it makes sense that it would stick to the tried and tested formula. And it works, to a point. Races and the spectacle that ensues are wild and unpredictable in the ways they should be, but beyond the updated visuals, the overall package comes with a mess of annoyances. Uninspired presentation--poor music, bland menus, terrible engine tones--blends in with merciless AI and a broken sense of progression to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/flatout-4-total-insanity/">Flatout 4</a> seem more flat than fantastic.</p><p>As is standard in Flatout games, the aim of Flatout 4 is to race hard around a variety of open roads littered with objects to smash your way through, Demo Derby-style. You can do this a few different ways: career, Flatout mode, quickplay or multiplayer--either couch competitive or online. Car handling is simple but wildly inconsistent, allowing easy slides and handbrake turns but also leaving you at the mercy of the track. You might run over a small bump and not notice it one lap, only for it to roll you over the next. The AI racers are utterly ruthless--perhaps too much so--as they fling all sense of self-preservation out the window in relentless pursuit of destruction. It’s a common sight to see an opponent fly overhead, upside down and facing backwards, crashing into the side of a house and bringing it down around them, only to land on their wheels and speed off. It’s moments like this where the stars align and, just for that split second, Flatout 4 feels right. But that feeling never lasts long, quickly turning to angst at the idea of having to repeat the same races over again.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437755" data-src="/videos/flatout-4-total-insanity-launch-trailer/2300-6437755/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437755/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">Of the four main modes, Flatout is by far the best, offering a series of challenges combining race, survivor and stunt events. It’s the mode that makes the most sense as it’s the easiest to get into, serving up a varied mix of race types, from standard races to the weaponised assault races, as well as different stunts and time trials. The cars are picked out for you, and the collective points you earn from each event tally up to unlock new ones. If only the same sense of urgency in getting you amongst the action existed in the other modes.</p><p dir="ltr">The career attempts to add some depth in the form of car purchases and upgrades, but the rewards it doles out for winning races versus taking down opponents is diametrically opposed, making progressing through each championship feel like a hefty grind. Points from wins unlock more races while cash, of which you earn a small amount for winning but a much larger amount for taking down opponent’s mid-race, lets you buy better cars to race with. Often, especially early on, I felt like I was forced to make a choice between going for wins or takedowns; compromising between cash for new cars or points for new races, which is a weird choice to have to make. Rewards do get slightly better as you progress, but getting there is a slog.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3214326-image00.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3214326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3214326-image00.jpg"><img alt="If you ruin this part, it's hard to come back from it" src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3214326-image00.jpg" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3214326-image00.jpg 1920w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3214326-image00.jpg 1280w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3214326-image00.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>If you ruin this part, it's hard to come back from it</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The only way to unlock new cars is by winning consecutive gold cups, which is excessively demanding for a game that already asks a lot of you. Cars aren’t just locked for career mode either, but most of the tracks and cars in quickplay are also inexplicably locked, with no indication as to how to change that. During the career, had the early game rewards and unlocks been more lenient, a new car or two could’ve spiced things up, at least for a few races. But thanks to the repetitive nature of the tracks, frugal rewards just add to the grinding nature of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">At least when you jump online into Flatout 4’s multiplayer, you get access to every car and track, giving you an opportunity to test out the differences in each. Vehicle handling varies considerably, to the point where, if you play the game long enough, you’ll want to exploit a different car for each track. Online multiplayer is fun in the right company, but some glaring omissions make it hard to come back to. The lack of bots to fill out empty spaces means, unless you have at least three other friends with Flatout 4, it might make for a pretty lonely experience. Public lobbies exist, but they have been practically empty since release day.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3214325-image03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3214325" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3214325-image03.jpg"><img alt="Sparks were flying between Gina Paintball and I" src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3214325-image03.jpg" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3214325-image03.jpg 1920w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3214325-image03.jpg 1280w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3214325-image03.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>Sparks were flying between Gina Paintball and I</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Visually, Flatout 4 impresses but doesn’t dazzle. God rays poke down through the trees while sparks scatter brightly as cars rub and scrape, and there is no shortage of trackside details to smash through. It aims to hit 30 frames per second, but at least does so consistently, only dipping at the very start of a race when all the cars are bouncing off each other and exaggerated track particles are flung back into your face.</p><p dir="ltr">Flatout 4 doesn’t bring anything noteworthy to the series, and while the Flatout and party modes are good for some low stakes enjoyment, the grind of single-player progression is too much to bare. The challenge is borderline unfair at times, and that wrecks the partytime nature that the series used to do so well.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 19:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416644</guid><dc:creator>James Swinbanks</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/172/1720905/3214328-flatout-4-review-thumb-nologo.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Thimbleweed Park Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thimbleweed-park-review/1900-6416642/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/thimbleweed-park/">Thimbleweed Park</a>, a point-and-click adventure by famed ex-LucasArts duo Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, rides a thin line between nostalgia and reinvention, balancing its remembrances for the time-honored genre with a sliver of modern sensibilities. It's a picturesque window into the past that's more than it appears to be. But at the same time, its adherence to the genre's long-held tenets is a firm reminder why adventure games alienated even their most diehard fans in the late '90s. Despite this, Thimbleweed Park is a journey well worth taking for experienced adventure game fans eager to solve its myriad puzzles and uncover its secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">The story begins with a murder in the small town of Thimbleweed Park, and two FBI detectives, Antonio Reyes and Angela Ray, are tasked with investigating the killing. The trail to the culprit leads them down a path of intrigue that has them unearthing dark secrets concerning the town's history and inhabitants.</p><div data-embed-type="video"

though its quirky tone and hammy dialogue drive it more towards supernatural comedy than surreal, psychological thriller. It constantly breaks the fourth wall by reminding players of its pixelated art style and its idiosyncrasies as a point-and-click adventure--there's even a character whose primary motivation is to get a job making text adventures for a company analogous to LucasArts. These stylistic and charming touches enrich the narrative, giving the storytelling an air of lighthearted self-awareness that rides through up until its cataclysmic conclusion.</p><p dir="ltr">Further complementing the narrative is an eccentric cast of characters who, at each twist and turn, contribute a wealth of witty remarks and general ridiculousness to the proceedings. For instance, the town's sheriff attaches the phrase "a-reno" at the end of a random word in his sentences. The town's coroner shares this habit but affixes "a-hoo" to the ends of phrases instead. It's made obvious in the beginning that these two characters are in fact the same person, yet everyone in town seems to believe they're separate individuals purely based on the fact that they each use different end phrases. Gags like this are plentiful and exist in nearly everyone you meet. It's a driving force for every encounter, as you often look forward to seeing what peculiarity you're going to find next.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1552/15524586/3214181-thimbleweedpark-reyes-coroner.png" data-ref-id="1300-3214181" data-ratio="0.56259780907668" data-width="1278" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1278px"><a href="https://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1552/15524586/3214181-thimbleweedpark-reyes-coroner.png"><img alt="The game's puzzles accommodate a wide range of logic and observation skill levels, rarely requiring too much stretching of the imagination to solve." src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1552/15524586/3214181-thimbleweedpark-reyes-coroner.png" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1552/15524586/3214181-thimbleweedpark-reyes-coroner.png 1278w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1552/15524586/3214181-thimbleweedpark-reyes-coroner.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>The game's puzzles accommodate a wide range of logic and observation skill levels, rarely requiring too much stretching of the imagination to solve.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Thimbleweed Park is less restricted than its linear contemporaries and predecessors, as it contains a fair number of puzzles and locations you can freely discover and tackle in any order you please. You start as Reyes and Ray, and can switch between them at will. But as you advance, you eventually control five characters, each with their own unique motivations and puzzles to solve. If you run into a bind with one protagonist, you're free to switch to another to try to make progress elsewhere. The high number of playable characters offers a welcome diversity to the experience that remedies the slog of figuring out what to do next.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, the puzzles accommodate a wide range of logic and observation skill levels, rarely requiring too much stretching of the imagination to solve. While some are as simple as combining an object with another in your inventory, others are far more intricate. One sequence has you trying to lure a character out of their office so you can steal an item. But in order to do so, you need to have another character use a device elsewhere to convince them to check out a "situation" brewing across town. Despite how infrequently puzzles break away from the usual dilemmas you'd expect to see in a game of this nature, they still maintain a decent level of challenge and complexity without becoming too obtuse.</p><p dir="ltr">However, some are marred by design issues and contextual inconsistencies. While the game's open design is one of its strongest qualities, it sometimes impedes your ability to solve puzzles effectively--the freedom you have to solve them in different orders often results in confusion. For example, an item you receive from a character clues you in to a secret meeting somewhere in town. But the location of said meeting requires going back to a location you probably thought you were done with. The freedom you have to solve quandaries sometimes makes it tough to decipher the presented clues. And given that solutions are incredibly specific and occasionally require multiple steps, it's often difficult to figure out what to do as you accumulate more items and clues.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1552/15524586/3214193-thimbleweedpark-ransome-delores-trampoline.png" data-ref-id="1300-3214193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1552/15524586/3214193-thimbleweedpark-ransome-delores-trampoline.png"><img alt="A lack of context almost constantly muddles the world's logic and occasionally complicates puzzle solving.

For example, one puzzle has you leaning on a character's tech background to fix a machine critical to the murder investigation. While this makes sense in the context of the puzzle-solving process, there's never a revelatory moment that links her motivations with the agents she's helping. She fixed this machine, but why? The narrative eventually frames its five protagonists as a team working under a common goal to unravel the mystery, but it never acknowledges their feelings regarding this arrangement or even how it comes to be. In turn, this lack of context almost constantly muddles the world's logic and occasionally complicates puzzle solving.</p><p dir="ltr">In the face of its issues, Thimbleweed Park still manages to retain the charm of the era it evokes. Yes, it inevitably falls into the standard genre structure of adventuring to and fro, picking up items, and interacting with the environment to solve a bevy of problems that require highly specific solutions. And as you'd expect, the moments spent in between trying to figure out everything are just as irritating and demoralizing as you remember. It's unapologetic in how it caters to its niche audience more than anyone else. But when all of this comes to a head in the game's final moments, the experiences of your journey are forever changed. Without spoiling anything, something occurs that affects your entire perception of the game's events--and subsequent playthroughs. The revelation elevates the game beyond its retrospective nature and design.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

experiences that channel the rose-tinted memories from our formative years of gaming, but sometimes what we end up getting isn't what we expected. Thimbleweed Park is a time capsule that reminds us what we love about the point-and-click genre while still retaining many of its unremedied issues. Its amusing open world is packed with infectious personalities and clever puzzles that magnify the joy of its experiences. And its efforts to shift beyond the template of its predecessors and contemporaries make it surprisingly affecting, especially if you're a longtime devotee of point-and-click adventures. The game's reverence for the past and its eventual conclusion could very well fly over the heads of the uninitiated. But make no mistake, Thimbleweed Park recaptures the charm of the games from which it draws inspiration, presenting a worthwhile experience for those who've been playing them since the beginning.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 14:34:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416642</guid><dc:creator>Matt Espineli</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1552/15524586/3214273-thimbleweed-park-review-thumb.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>

Here, at the edge of the world, an old woman quips that she feels like a god, looking over all creation as it races toward the end--of everything. These twisted landscapes make for a surreal backdrop and a fitting metaphor for the final chapter of Dark Souls. It's fortunate, then, that the Ringed City doesn't waste any of that creative energy.</p><p dir="ltr">As weird as the worlds of Dark Souls can be, their brutality tends to keep them grounded and tangible. With the Ringed City, however, those pretenses fall away. Your introduction shunts you through a series of monster-packed corridors interspersed with steep, bizarrely nonlethal drops down cliffs. These show your gradual descent into the nightmarish plane of the Ringed City--an apparent mosaic of the series' past settings now caked in ash and dust--and balance moments of desperation against bursts of fatalism. It's striking, tense, and emblematic of the expansion as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ringed City takes all of Dark Souls' ideas and presses them to their extreme. In previous games, high-risk, high-reward play was advantageous--but it's essential here. You won't find your first bonfire (a shelter from the universe's grotesque monsters) for quite some time, and even then it doesn't seem too useful. You'll rush out and die, without a chance to learn much.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

The subsequent salvo of golden light-spears can tear through your health in an instant if you're not careful. And these angels can't be killed directly. At first, that seems like a breach of the series' guiding mantra of "tough but fair." However, it's there to upend expectations and encourage new styles of play--in this case, stealth--that the series had yet to explore. Once you know where and how to move, the area's still a challenge, but in true Souls fashion, it’s far from insurmountable.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a shame, then, that The Ringed City's brisk pace just isn't enough to give these new ideas the attention they deserve. Just as each new concept starts coming into view, you move on. An undercurrent of weighty themes and a dense overworld more than compensate, however. As a send-off for this trilogy, The Ringed City has to tie a lot of disparate threads together, and it manages this by focusing on its characters.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">City has a total of four unique bosses -- more than any other such add-on for any game in the series -- and each is a blast.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Figures like Patches--a deceitful, murderous thief--conclude their arcs here. People in the Dark Souls universe fade as their will does. Over time, they lose their minds and go "hollow." Throughout the series, this little bit of lore has been leveraged as an analogue for the player. If the game gets too hard and you give up, your avatar could be thought of as "going hollow" within your game world. It's telling, then, that on the precipice of the apocalypse, the folks who made it are dogged, albeit with banal drives. These games have always used conviction of purpose as an analogue for how a weak-willed person can persist in spite of suffering. Patches, while he lacks compassion and strength of character, lives on through greed and suffering--tortured though his soul may be. Unearthing what sorts of karma this world holds for cheats becomes one of many lenses The Ringed City holds up for you. In effect, it asks you to look back on your time with these characters and stories and reflect on what they've meant to you.</p><p dir="ltr">Those less interested in dissecting what it all means will have plenty to chew on as well. The Ringed City has a total of four unique bosses--more than any other such add-on for any game in the series--and confronting each is a blast. Nothing here is half-done, and it shows. As with the rest of the expansion, bosses here remix classic ideas and incorporate a bevy of new twists.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery"

dir="ltr">The last duel is a poetic conclusion, pitting you against a force tied to the fate of the world and one of the series’ biggest mysteries--the story of the furtive pygmy. The fight is raw and chaotic, with your enemy mirroring the patterns and strikes of Artorias, a warrior corrupted by darkness and the central figure of the five-year old Artorias of the Abyss expansion. Exactly who the final boss of the series is, I'll leave out, but it does provide a perfect narrative arc for the franchise to end on.</p><p dir="ltr">Scenes like that are where Dark Souls succeeds best. It's not just inventive level design or epic boss battles or an engaging story--it's how they're seamlessly woven together. And that's made even more memorable when the choreography of a battle gives slight nods to its inspiration. Make no mistake, though: While The Ringed City, much like Dark Souls III as a whole, leans a bit on nostalgia and allusions, it earns an esteemed space alongside its forebears.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ringed City moves and ends a little too quickly--well before it gets all the mileage it can out of its setting and premises--but that's a small knock against what’s otherwise an exceptional send-off. A well of inspired locales and a renewed focus on the series' obsession with cycles, death and rebirth, and the passage of time, plus a few spectacularly designed and animated foes round out a worthy conclusion to a storied franchise.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 14:33:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416643</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Starkey</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/3214237-4038819410-Dark-.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Stories Untold Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stories-untold-review/1900-6416641/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>The free release of <a href="https://jonnocode.itch.io/the-house-abandon">The House Abandon on itch.io</a> last August caught on slowly among horror enthusiasts, eventually developing a solid following. It wields the aesthetics of an old text adventure--right down to the computer itself, which is positioned on a wooden desk next to family photos, giving you a ‘game within a game’ perspective--and twists them into something horrifying.</p><p>An updated version of The House Abandon headlines <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/stories-untold/">Stories Untold</a>, a four-part horror anthology about poking around with old technology until that technology pokes you back. It’s the simplest episode in the package, tasking you with typing in commands that will be familiar to anyone who has ever typed ‘use key on door’. Straightforward, simple instructions (‘move to hallway’, ‘check note’) are typically all you need, although it requires you to be quite precise with your wording, sometimes irritatingly so. For the first half of The House Abandon you mentally map out your character’s family home, where he has returned for what seems like a much-needed holiday. Things take a turn when you find your old computer in-game, and load up the game inside of it, and The House Abandon goes a bit <em>Inception</em> on you – you’re playing a game within a game within a game, but your actions start to reverberate right back to the first layer. To say too much more, or to talk about how much the game manages to do with its one static fixed camera angle, would detract from its effect.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437071" data-src="/videos/stories-untold-teaser-trailer/2300-6437071/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437071/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">It’s a great introduction for the collection, where all four episodes focus on the aesthetics and potent strangeness of older technologies. The episodes move between different settings, but the setup is always the same - you’re sitting in front of various pieces of technology, and you need to figure out how to interact with them to move forward. Most of the time you have access to only one or two areas, which you can flit between with the tab key, and your actions are limited to clicking and pulling at objects with the mouse or typing commands. There’s a strong sense of being trapped, of your fate being inevitable and tied to these old, dying pieces of technology, that Stories Untold feeds off of. Taken as a whole, these episodes elegantly explore the central tension of many horror games--that the player is the driving force, and able to stop playing and put an end to their fears at any point. One of the major themes running through the anthology as a whole is that the horrors visited upon the player are avoidable, and that you’re bringing them upon yourself through your actions. Finishing each episode means pushing forward well beyond the point where it makes sense to do so, but that’s not a bad thing--the tension ramps right up when you start to feel yourself heading in a bad direction. In this way, Stories Untold is an introspective game, one that seems keen to examine the horror genre just as much as it wants to exist within it.</p><p dir="ltr">The House Abandon is the scariest part of the package, but the second and third episodes--The Lab Conduct and The Station Process--are both more engaging and difficult. Both involve manipulating various apparatuses with the mouse, while reading in-game manuals that give you instructions for different operations. They’re entirely focused on flicking switches and twisting knobs, on recreating often awkward physical interactions with digital artefacts, conducting mundane actions that ultimately bring about horrifying results.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3213704-storiesuntold1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3213704" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3213704-storiesuntold1.jpg"><img alt="The Lab Conduit starts strange and does not let up." src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3213704-storiesuntold1.jpg" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3213704-storiesuntold1.jpg 1920w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3213704-storiesuntold1.jpg 1280w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3213704-storiesuntold1.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>The Lab Conduit starts strange and does not let up.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">In The Lab Conduit, you’re operating on a mysterious heart that pulsates from within the box it’s held in. It’s a strange set-up that retains its mystique over the episode’s hour-long playtime. You follow instructions from a bored voice over a PA, flitting between the equipment provided and the instruction manual, which is stored on a creaky old black-and-green monitor. Eventually the episode twists in a brilliantly odd direction, throwing lots of concepts your way at once and asking you to try and digest a sudden influx of knowledge. The actions the game requires of you can be quite mundane and a tad repetitive, but the outcomes, and ever-increasing strangeness of your situation, imbue actions as simple as turning a dial with real tension.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Station Process, you’re monitoring activity from a snowy research base, tuning your equipment to pick up increasingly panicked radio broadcasts from the other facilities. This episode offers the compilation’s most challenging puzzles, requiring you to navigate your way through a painfully laid-out manual, twisting its orientation and shifting zoom and focus with knobs and sliders to figure out what to do next. A cold wind rattles the windows, and it becomes increasingly clear that something awful is happening outside.</p><figure data-align="right" data-size="medium" data-img-src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3213706-storiesuntold2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3213706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3213706-storiesuntold2.jpg"><img alt="Most codes aren’t given to you as easily as the Post-It note code here." src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3213706-storiesuntold2.jpg" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/172/1720905/3213706-storiesuntold2.jpg 1920w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/172/1720905/3213706-storiesuntold2.jpg 1280w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/172/1720905/3213706-storiesuntold2.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>Most codes aren’t given to you as easily as the Post-It note code here.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">These two episodes are Stories Untold at its best. They do a great job of evoking the weird mechanics, the soft hums, and the awkward controls of the old devices you’re interacting with, and they both unfurl into fantastic, thought-provoking narratives. They’re not scary, but they’re shocking in ways that, again, would be spoiled if I revealed too many details. The Station Process ends in such a strange, exciting way that I went into the last episode with extremely high hopes.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, The Last Session--the fourth and final part of the package--is the compilation’s equivalent of that one film in every long running horror franchise that decides the viewer needs an explanation for why all those awful things happened. It’s the instalment that fails to recognise that the first three were successful, in part, because they were vague and mysterious, their weirdness left to fester in the player’s brain. The Last Session mixes gameplay elements from all the previous episodes, but it's more focused on narrative than the puzzles themselves. By trying to act as a conclusion to the whole package all it manages to do is confirm information many players will have already gleaned, and give unsatisfactory answers for questions that were best left unasked. It’s not without some cool moments, but part of me wishes I had stopped after three episodes.</p><p dir="ltr">Stories Untold’s first three episodes are very effective as retro horror vignettes, though, and the fourth can’t undo that. This is a unique package with a strong sense of identity, one that finds a new, exciting way to weaponize nostalgia. Just know that you might not look at the old Spectrum or Commodore 64 you’ve got packed away in the attic quite the same way again after playing.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 18:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416641</guid><dc:creator>James O'Connor</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/172/1720905/3213701-storiesuntold6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Persona 5 Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-5-review/1900-6416640/</link><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/persona-5/">Persona 5 </a>is a game overflowing with style. From bold black and red menus that leap off the screen to the pop-and-lock of scene transitions that carry the player from one colorful corner of Tokyo to the next, it's a game about youthful exuberance and the power that lies within it. But its beauty isn't just skin deep. Persona 5's gameplay systems evolve and coalesce over its 80+ hours to deliver a confidently executed role-playing experience that is not only satisfying, but worth the almost decade-long wait since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/">Persona 4</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessors, it's part social simulator, part dungeon crawler. By day, you're a high school student--busy taking classes, visiting cafes, watching movies, and hanging out with friends. But by night you are the leader of the Phantom Thieves, a ragtag troupe of idealistic teenagers that infiltrate a parallel reality called the Metaverse. Here, the corrupted hearts of adults have manifested as Palaces, and the Phantom Thieves must find and steal Treasures within them to reform their marks, and by extension, society. Think <em>Lupin the Third</em>, but with a socially conscious supernatural twist.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

Here lie physical representations of people's personalities, called Personas--angels, demons, and monsters of all shapes and sizes that you battle using elemental attacks. Physical moves can be used to chip away at health points incrementally, but exploiting an elemental weakness elevates battles from turn-based slapsies to a flurry of crushing combos. Hit an enemy weak to fire with Agi and it will crumple, giving you an additional turn to exploit another enemy's vulnerability, either by switching Persona to adopt a different elemental alignment or by passing the baton onto a teammate who can pick up where you left off. Once they've all keeled over, you can launch an All-Out Attack and watch as black silhouettes of your team dance across a striking red background, slicing and dicing enemies until they burst into a shower of blood. This triumphant animation calls to mind The Bride's iconic blue room battle against the Crazy 88 in <em>Kill Bill</em>, and even though you'll see it hundreds of times it never stops being cool.</p><p dir="ltr">Improvements to the battle system mean that if you've already identified an enemy's weakness, instead of trawling through menus to locate the specific ability, tapping R1 takes you straight to the move you need. When combined with the baton passing, streamline the turn-based fights into pacy experiences that maintain forward momentum with ease. There's nothing more satisfying than firing off Persona spells, tagging in teammates, and wiping out waves of Shadows without them even getting a look in. Persona 5's combat pulls together some of the best elements from previous games--and it's borderline addictive as a result.</p><blockquote data-align="right"><p dir="ltr">Persona 5's combat pulls together some of the best elements from previous games--and it's borderline addictive as a result.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Negotiations from early Shin Megami Tensei and Persona titles also make a return, but the system is much improved. If you knock down a Shadow, you'll surround it with guns drawn and can commence an All-Out Attack or simply talk to them. The conversation becomes a weird Q&amp;A about your character or society a whole, and it often throws up some hilarious dialogue. There's nothing quite like winning over a succubus by playing hard to get or gaining the favour of a giant demon sitting on a toilet by telling him you, too, are a pretty easy going kinda guy.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're successful or not, negotiating will get you something. You can demand items, money, or a monster's allegiance, but whether your request is granted depends on your gift of the gab. I found negotiation to be a much more useful reward system than the random pickings offered by Shuffle Time in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3/1900-6175580/">Persona 3 </a>and 4. When filling my Persona compendium or trying to fuse a specific Persona I'd ask them to join my cause. While grinding I'd use an All-Out Attack to earn more XP. In a pinch I'd demand an item. The new system let me reap the benefits I needed at that point in my playthrough.</p><p dir="ltr">Palaces are areas given form by the distorted desires of powerful, corrupted individuals, while the process of infiltrating is akin to pulling off a heist. You need to identify your target by conducting investigations in the real world, then enter the Palace to explore it and secure an infiltration route. Once you've located the corrupted heart of the individual--represented as an ethereal Treasure--you send a calling card to the target in the real world. This act of showmanship not only alerts the world to the target's misdeeds but also gives physical form to the Treasure in the Palace so it can be stolen.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437482" data-src="/videos/more-persona-5-english-gameplay-exploring-mementos/2300-6437482/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437482/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">And those Palaces are the best dungeons the series has ever had. No longer are you climbing through levels of procedurally generated corridors to reach a boss at the top. Instead, each Palace contains a myriad of puzzles to crack, traps to avoid, and of course, Shadows to defeat. They are intricate, striking locations that unravel as you explore them, each varying in size, scope, and gameplay opportunities. One is a rat maze filled with locked doors and looping hallways, another is a giant safe that you need to crack, and one is a crumbling pyramid filled with walking mummies. They feel almost like different worlds from a Mario game, each uniquely themed and cycling through gameplay ideas like cards in a rolodex.</p><p dir="ltr">As Phantom Thieves, you sneak through halls, darting between cover and jumping over obstacles. As you slink into the shadows and ambush an unsuspecting enemy, getting in that crucial first shot, you realize that these Palaces are designed for you to be sneaky. And it feels really satisfying to bounce between coverpoints and ambush an enemy … when it works. Although you're encouraged to take enemies out sneakily, doing so is made difficult by the game's uncooperative camera, which often restricts your view. Similarly, clambering over obstacles doesn't quite feel as good as it should. There are specific spots that you can climb up to access more areas and I often missed these because I wasn't standing in the pixel perfect point to get the prompt needed to jump.</p><p dir="ltr">But honestly, this is nitpicking. I loved my time in each of the Palaces, wandering around using my Third Eye Ability to uncover secrets and steal treasures, feeling like Batman on Opposite Day. Its puzzles never became too taxing, even in later dungeons that required backtracking to find a specific item, enemy, or switch using the Third Eye. In these areas the game mercifully opens up shortcuts for you, so you don't feel like you're wasting too much time.</p><blockquote data-align="left"><p dir="ltr">Persona 5 has a hefty run time and while the story remains engaging until its final moments, the gameplay has some pacing issues towards the end.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Balance in such a huge game is tricky. I played on Normal difficulty, and for the vast majority of the game enemies felt well-matched to my level. Persona 5 has a hefty run time and while the story remains engaging until its final moments, the gameplay has some pacing issues towards the end. Instakill attacks, a short supply of elemental power-refuelling SP items, and going long stretches of miniboss after miniboss without a save point mean the latter stages can sometimes feel more frustrating than enjoyable. I've been wiped out half an hour into a fight on multiple occasions, and I'm still a bit bitter.</p><p dir="ltr">But Palaces are just one part of the Metaverse. Once you take a Treasure, Palaces collapse, so they're not really the place to grind for levels. For those that enjoy the grind-heavy areas of P3's Tartarus and P4's randomly generated dungeons there's Mementos--society's joint Palace, which takes the form of the depths of Tokyo's subway system. This area is long, with many procedurally generated levels spiralling down towards a mysterious, seemingly unreachable core. It would feel like a monotonous job were it not for the Phansite. One of your Confidants believes so much in the plight of the Phantom Thieves that he sets up a website where members of the public can leave messages of support (or memes).</p><p dir="ltr">More importantly, Phansite users can suggest people they think deserve a change of heart. These are figures that aren't quite evil enough to have their own Palace, but who are still misbehaving enough to spawn a demi-boss within Mementos. These side stories of abusive boyfriends, scammers, and thieves are mere tasters--bite size chunks of justice that you can dole out at your leisure while grinding for experience. Infiltrating Palaces can sometimes take hours, so quickly dealing with a few Phansite Requests in one go is a satisfying microcosm of the larger gameplay loop in Persona 5. Plus it made me feel like Judge Dredd, dishing out justice as I saw fit to clean up the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

With limited time in each day and a constant deadline to steal Treasures by, it's up to the player to prioritize after-school and weekend activities. Attributes such as Knowledge, Charm, Proficiency, and Guts can be improved by studying, working in part-time jobs, crafting tools, or watching DVDs. In turn, these enable you to build deeper bonds with other characters to strengthen yourself and your cause.</p><p dir="ltr">Persona games live and die on characterisation as much as they do on the RPG mechanics that underpin the gameplay, and in that respect the latest entry delivers a cast that is loveable, quirky, and nuanced in equal measure. Although the main group neatly fits into classic anime archetypes initially, over time everyone reveals the baggage they carry and, as you solidify your bonds, they start to show their complexities, creating emotional moments where you work through their pain together.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes their goals will align with yours and sometimes they won't, so the group can be a little rowdier than previous Persona teams--but that only adds to the experience. I loved that you really had to invest time and effort into each character to crack their personality and unlock how they truly felt. Morgana the amnesic talking cat (it is a Japanese game, after all) is shrouded in mystery, determined to learn about his forgotten past. The quirky Futaba, despite suffering from extreme social anxiety, is the strategic genius behind the group's Metaverse adventures. Ryuji's boisterousness is both the energy the team needs to push forward and the powder keg that could be its undoing. And Ann deals with issues of self-doubt in the competitive field of modelling. These characters grow and change as you spend more time with them: They go from being mechanical tools that you engage with to strengthen their Personas, to real people you can identify and sympathize with. By the time the credits rolled, I felt like I was leaving behind friends I had known for years.</p><p dir="ltr">Building these relationships with teammates is key to success in the Metaverse. Increasing Confidant Ranks (a rebrand of the Social Link system from Persona 4) by spending time with each of your friends not only affords you deeper insight into their personalities, but also provides bonuses and special moves in battle. A teammate who initially was closed off and distant in the real world can end up literally taking a bullet for you in the Metaverse. Similarly, by improving your personal traits through daily activities you can meet a variety of side-characters that teach you new abilities or offer bonuses that feed back into the battle system.</p><p dir="ltr">More than any entry in the series before it, Persona 5 manages to make the mundane not only fit into its gameplay loop but be essential to it. Atlus has perfected the back and forth investment and reward dynamic between the game's two parts to point where even doing laundry is gratifying--and how many games can you say that about?</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437052" data-src="/videos/persona-5-english-gameplay-how-it-compares-to-pers/2300-6437052/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437052/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">While there are moments of levity in Persona 5, the actions of the Phantom Thieves are important and often have much bigger implications than even they intended. Persona 5 deals with complex subject matter and really doesn't shy away from dark, even uncomfortable, story beats. A constant theme of the game is oppression and injustice, specifically how people can be suffering them in silence. It uses personal hardships and the pressures of modern day society to explore how the actions of the older generation affect the future of the youth. But there's also an optimism to it all. Its cast approaches complex issues and takes on overwhelming odds with a clarity and gusto that can only be born from teenage naivety, and there's a refreshing, cathartic quality to being part of that. But of course, just like in the real world, things aren't always black and white, and the game does an excellent job of showing how even well-meaning actions can have adverse consequences.</p><p dir="ltr">Narratively and thematically, Persona 5 has the potential to overwhelm--particularly once it starts digging into Jungian theories of psychology. Thankfully, however, the writing does a fantastic job of eliminating unnecessary exposition, which ensures the important storylines are clear and everyone--especially series newcomers--is on the same page. It means the first ten hours are a little slow, and may make a lot of surface level observations, but not to the detriment of the story or its characters. Even with the heavy subject matter, it doesn't become overbearing and in fact is filled with little jokes and easter eggs to lighten the mood where appropriate. The localisation team has done a superb job of translating the comedy for a Western audience, too. I'm a big fan of the DVDs you can rent--spoofs of popular Western media like '<em>The X-Folders</em>' or '<em>Bubbly Hills, 90210</em>.'</p><p>Within Persona 5 is a complex set of interconnected gameplay mechanics, and in almost every aspect Atlus has executed on its vision exceptionally, barring the pacing issues towards the end. At every turn, it presents something to marvel at, whether it's the fluid combat, vibrant world, or the many memorable characters. It's a game I could talk about for hours; I haven't mentioned the ability to connect to the Thieves Guild, which lets you see how other players spent their day or ask them for help answering questions at school. Or the thumping acid-jazz-infused soundtrack that I've not been able to get out of my head. Or even just the joy of seeing how it stylishly transitions between menus. But that encapsulates why Persona 5 is a game that shouldn't be missed. It's stuffed to bursting point with gameplay ideas and presentation flourishes--there's an overwhelming level of artistry in every part of Persona 5, making it a truly standout entry in the series. It's a refined, effortlessly stylish RPG that will be talked about for years to come.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416640</guid><dc:creator>Lucy James</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1542/15425433/3213271-4536443952-perso.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Everything Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/everything-review/1900-6416639/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine taking a philosophy class where a brilliant, engaging, charismatic professor opens your mind and helps you see the world like you never have before who also pauses every few minutes to play a Frank Zappa album. That should give you a rough idea of what it's like to play Everything. It's a game that manages to convey profound beauty and a sense of one's place in the universe that's periodically undercut by a compulsive need to interject a sense of twee and abstract randomness. It's hard to tell how seriously you're supposed to take it all.</p><p dir="ltr">Everything is an interactive art project that allows you to transform into nearly any object you find, from planets all the way down to microbes. There are no traditional goals, and except for one particular area, Everything has no hard-and-fast boundaries. It's just you and the universe, with nothing standing in your way.</p><p dir="ltr">The dissonance starts from the very beginning. At the outset, you're a bear in a vast woodland full of creatures living out their lives. They move around by tumbling end over end, stiff as boards, like they're auditioning to be new Tetris blocks. After spending some time learning the basic controls, you can roam around freely, “sing” to other creatures and things, learn how to hear their thoughts, and figure out how to talk to them to gain their trust and move in groups. It's the game at its most playful: rocks, animals, and houses will grouse about a friend who's a jerk or cheerily go on about what a nice day it is all while doing perpetual faceplants to get around.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437656" data-src="/videos/everything-gameplay-trailer/2300-6437656/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437656/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">Eventually, one of the plants, animals, or objects you encounter tells you that you can explore things on a smaller scale--and thus, you learn the Descend ability, which allows you to embody a different creature on a lower plane of existence. That’s neat by itself, but the real magic occurs when you realize that you don't have to stop there. Embodying something like an insect is step one. Step two is inhabiting miniscule things like pollen or hair. You can then continue downward to atomic structures, and finally subatomic particles. The trick goes the other direction as well. A bear can Ascend and become a sequoia tree, which can become an entire continent. A continent can Ascend to become a planet, which can become a sun, which can become a galaxy.</p><p dir="ltr">The ease with which you can become one of a diverse set of objects across multiple planes of existence feels like a technical marvel. Everything's long-term memory is impressive as well. You can spend a solid hour exploring atoms in a blade of grass. When you eventually ascend, the game will remember the group of ants you corralled into service nearby, no matter how far you go.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">If your greatest gaming dream is to assemble a street gang made up of two teapots, an eyeball, a saxophone, and a banana that misses its sister, Everything is the game for you.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Everything is at its most powerful when it provides humbling, awe-inspiring moments of scale, held even further aloft by sound bytes of the late British philosopher Alan Watts that arise along the way. Watts' ongoing narration may be the game's strongest core component, as it provides a sense of neo-spiritualist context to everything you see and experience. Exploring the very building blocks of reality is powerful on its own, but Everything achieves something deeper with the gentle, playful reminder that this, too, is us.</p><p dir="ltr">How, then, do you marry that with the ability to hop down the street as an refinery's smokestack, or talking with a monkey about how dumb his friends are? The answer: You don't. There’s an element of wacky, dadaist humor to Everything that, at its most absurd, brings back memories of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/katamari-damacy/">Katamari Damacy</a>'s endless amusement; being able to roll the most random things up in a ball and watching them squirm around, making noises until the ball is big enough to swallow planets whole. You can't roll things up here, but if your greatest gaming dream is to assemble a street gang made up of two teapots, an eyeball, a saxophone, and a banana that misses its sister, Everything is the game for you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/3209932-preview_screenshot3_141331.jpg"

of Everything. If the point is to invoke a sense of existentialist zen, it accomplishes that, but it subsequently undercuts the accomplishment with a sense of lame, abstract humor. If the point is to invent a wild playground where everything that exists has a self-centered consciousness all its own, it’s that as well--in which case, it's almost taking Alan Watts' ideas to Looney Tunes levels of ridiculousness. When those two elements are at odds, the game seems to lose all meaning.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a grave disservice, too. More than a few games are able to deliver this brand of random crazy on a far more enjoyable, technically polished scale than this--the very “ending” of the game feeling like an inadvertent homage to the intro of every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/littlebigplanet/">LittleBigPlanet</a> game just solidifies that fact. But the number of games able to so effectively recontextualize how you think about your place in the universe in an interactive medium is paltry. That crazy game of playing as random stuff is disposable. That game of realizing we are all one is vital. A combination of the two thrown together, Everything becomes staggering in its ambition--and yet deeply disappointing.</p><p> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 17:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416639</guid><dc:creator>Justin Clark</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/3209931-7667705940-every.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
<item><title>Malicious Fallen Review</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/malicious-fallen-review/1900-6416637/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Malicious Fallen may not be developed by Platinum Games, but it sure does look the part. This may have something to do with the fact that developer Alvion supported Platinum Games during the development of such titles as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/bayonetta-2/">Bayonetta 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/anarchy-reigns/">Anarchy Reigns</a> to name a few. Malicious Fallen delivers some beautiful, colorful, anime-inspired visuals, and presents a familiar approach to massive-scale fights and flashy combo attacks. But that’s not enough to shake the feeling we've seen it done bigger, better, and more cohesively elsewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">Malicious Fallen tells the tale of a land ruled by an insane king whose wife makes a deal with supernatural powers in order to end her husband's reign of terror. After he's gone, however, she finds herself more than a little hesitant to give up on her power trip. She becomes the new despot, subsequently granting her best warriors a share of the glory in rampaging across the countryside. A group of prophets, loyal to the powers beyond, have you in their back pocket. You play the part of the Spirit Vessel, who's been imbued with all the remaining magical power left in the universe, along with a cape called the Mantle of Cinders, to go forth and triumph over evil.</p><p dir="ltr">Since all of this is presented in text form, however, it ends up as an easily missable cover story for what essentially boils down to a dazzling boss rush that throws you to the wolves within minutes of starting the game. You're given a short, perfunctory tutorial, a series of portals to choose from, and off you go. The brevity of training could be forgiven if the game were more of an arcade-style brawler where you only really need to know how to hit, dodge, and maybe perform a flashy special, but Malicious Fallen--to its credit and curse--offers a combat system full of tiny intricacies that only really come together via rigorous, Sisyphean trial-and-error.</p><figure data-align="center"

of Cinders can turn into a shield for defense, a set of giant fists for close-quarters combat, or it can fire a ranged attack that can target whatever's directly in front, and potentially barrage multiple enemies. To add an extra level of complexity, you can also alter attacks so that enemies who die explode, chaining damage to other nearby enemies. All of this is adds points into a resource called Aura.</p><p dir="ltr">Aura is everything in Malicious Fallen. Not only is it the resource that you use to heal, but when your Aura stash is full, you're allowed to unleash extremely high-powered attacks that can make relatively quick work of the game's massive bosses. All of this is technically explained in the tutorial, but these instructions mean little without context; you're ultimately left to figure out how to handle Aura on the fly, and likely die several times in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">The other gameplay element is a Mega Man-style system where every boss drops a new ability for you to use, and figuring out which ability will have maximum effect against each boss--or even whether what you have available will even make a dent--is, again, a trial-and-error process. It requires that you get very comfortable with each bosses' patterns and attacks, but it also means a lot of wrestling with the game's twitchy camera. It's the basis for a woefully unintuitive targeting system that only focuses on the boss, and sometimes has trouble even activating. It's not unusual to end up on your back, suffering from a barrage of cheap hits for prolonged periods of time, all because you weren't able to target properly. The kicker? Your life force is measured by having limbs and parts of your outfit knocked off--which, on a busy battlefield, can be near impossible to monitor. Typically, it's not until a single hit results in an unexpected game over that you realize how far gone you were.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

found. The game's ornate cathedrals and rollicking battlefields are, at times, breathtaking spectacles. The bosses themselves are fantastically designed, and just watching them move and react is impressive. While combat is poorly explained, going back to older bosses with a new arsenal and a better understanding of the game makes for a gratifying form of payback.</p><p dir="ltr">The fact remains that you have to perform a lot of legwork to understand how each boss works in respect to your abilities. There's a fine line to be crossed in a boss rush game, where hard fought battles lead to either sighs of relief or aggravated groans. Too often, Malicious Fallen earns the latter. Malicious Fallen isn’t a game that feels triumphant so much as tiring.</p><p> </p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416637</guid><dc:creator>Justin Clark</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1406/14063904/3208829-8024832457-Malic.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>

Within that short span of time, I'd already encountered unconvincing animations, bog standard missions, clunky user interface, stilted dialogue--basically every red flag you hope to avoid when approaching a lengthy shooter-RPG powered equally by action and story.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, Andromeda did improve. As I progressed, I unlocked exhilarating new combat options, met characters with deeper appeal than my initial crew, and discovered freely explorable worlds that finally fulfilled the series' decade-old planet-hopping promise. And yet, some of those early problems persisted throughout, and while I did catch glimmers of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/mass-effect/">original trilogy's</a> greatness, that shine was often dulled by lifeless dialogue, tedious missions, and even technical shortcomings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

Several disasters later, Ryder inherits her dad's job, and while the moments leading to and including that scene are pretty hackneyed, the stakes really sink in once you reach the Nexus--Andromeda's version of the earlier games' Citadel.</p><p dir="ltr">Here you discover the other three other arks have gone missing and that the Nexus, which arrived ahead of the arks, has suffered every setback imaginable, from growing food shortages to a veritable civil war. With leadership in shambles and no resources to revive the cryogenically frozen colonists, the sudden arrival of an ark immediately lands Ryder in an uncomfortable position of power. In practice, the scenario felt more believable than typical "you are the chosen one" cliches. I understood why those characters would look to me and felt the weight of their desperation. So when the Nexus gradually sprang to life as I started fixing problems, I felt genuinely accomplished.</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr">The central storyline revolves around an evil alien race and its narcissistic leader.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">In parallel with this more broadly-focused narrative--which encompasses much of the side content--the central storyline revolves around an evil alien race and its delusional, narcissistic leader, who poses a more immediate threat than food shortages. He's less one-dimensional than he initially seems, but the plot is largely predictable in a mindless blockbuster sort of way. The two stories intersect occasionally, and both pay off in the end.</p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, Andromeda's story problems stem more from delivery than from plot. The vast majority of Andromeda's characters are just dull, and conversations rarely delve deeper than arduous "get to know you" small talk. No one yells or cries or expresses any measurable emotion at any point, even when they explicitly talk about their feelings, and there's no Tyrion Lannister or Francis Underwood to keep things interesting. There was plenty of room for Game of Thrones-style power struggles on the Nexus, yet all political disagreements are merely mentioned without being explored. Even romance options feel stilted, and the culminating scene I unlocked for successfully wooing a crew member was not as explicit or exciting as you might expect.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437586" data-src="/videos/mass-effect-andromeda-launch-trailer/2300-6437586/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437586/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">Worse still, your agency in these conversations is limited. Sure, you can periodically select from up to four dialogue options, but these frequently boil down to "be optimistic" or "be realistic." On paper, this system improves over the rigid renegade/paragon dichotomy of the original series, but in practice, the various options felt only superficially different. And regardless of what I picked, my inputs only rarely impacted the outcome. Even when I tried to be rude, characters generally found a way to shrug it off. And after beating the campaign, I can only recall one major decision that had serious repercussions, and even that felt contrived. It also paled in comparison to the memorably gut-wrenching choices forced on me in the original games.</p><p dir="ltr">In fairness, Andromeda did sometimes surprise me with poignant moments, like my crew comforting me in a dark hour and a conversation with my partner AI about the meaning of life. The game just buries these gems under hours of empty or even cringe-worthy interactions filled with heavy-handed themes, awkward lines of dialogue, and weird idiomatic phrases that felt out of place in a far flung galaxy. What person says "What's the word on the street?" without irony in 2017 let alone 600-plus years in the future?</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="left"><p dir="ltr">Andromeda's worlds are breathtaking to behold and exciting to explore.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, I didn't have to dig as deep to find the things Andromeda does well. Its worlds, for example, are breathtaking to behold and exciting to explore. You eventually uncover four mini-open worlds, as well as smaller, standalone areas like an overgrown jungle outpost and your own ship, The Tempest. The four major maps are sizable and offer drastically different environments and hazards, from frozen wastelands to arid deserts to unruly jungles. They're also filled with NPCs to chat up and side missions to undertake. You could end up solving murders in a pirate port, betting at a Krogan fighting pit, or unlocking secrets in ancient yet hyper-advanced vaults. Or you could just wheel around in your Nomad. The galaxy is vast and varied, and that's worth being excited about.</p><p dir="ltr">I also fell in love with the combat, especially later in the game. The core shooting mechanics feel stronger here than anywhere else in the series, and the flexibility of the progression system let me cherry pick cool powers rather than locking me into a set character class. I ended up building, well...a space ninja, basically. I could use tech to cloak myself, biotics to charge enemies, a shield-buffing sword to deal damage, and the standard jumpjets to dart away again. The results were consistently frantic and fun, though there are plenty of other options as well. I enjoyed nearly everything I experimented with, even if most enemies proved to be predictable adversaries.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6437702" data-src="/videos/mass-effect-andromeda-multiplayer-livestream/2300-6437702/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%"><iframe src="/videos/embed/6437702/" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir="ltr">Combat's one major flaw is the crafting system. I would call it more of a missed opportunity than a problem, but crafting is often the only way to get the weapons and armor you actually want, which means hours of scanning objects to accrue research points and many headaches dealing with the messy UI. Even bare essentials like comparing weapon stats can be tricky or even impossible. The crafting and loadout stations are also at opposite ends of the Tempest, which routinely forced me to run back and forth to get things done. You will occasionally find loot around the world, but it's severely utilized as a reward mechanic. I felt deeply satisfied when I finally completed my perfect loadout, but I'm not sure it was worth the energy.</p><p dir="ltr">Crafting isn't Andromeda's biggest time-waster, however. That would be its tedious missions. Far too many open world quests--even some that feel important or come packaged in an interesting premise--devolve into multistep "go here, hit a button" errands. There's always another navpoint somewhere across the map or an NPC who needs exactly three items or a crucial datapad that's unexpectedly missing when you arrive. I frequently felt like an intergalactic errand boy, mindlessly scanning everything in sight so my omniscience AI partner could do whatever the situation required and give me a new waypoint to reach.</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr">I frequently felt like an intergalactic errand boy, mindlessly scanning everything in sight.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">These missions aren't all bad, per se, but they desperately needed some editing--or at least a wider variety of gameplay scenarios. Forcing players to repeat the exact same action three times or drive across the map to interact with one prompt isn't fun--it's padding. The campaign and crew loyalty missions provide better crafted experiences, but there's no avoiding at least some of the unimaginative tedium, especially since you rarely receive enough information upfront to really know what you're getting into.</p><p dir="ltr">There is plenty to do outside of missions, however. Andromeda includes a somewhat convoluted meta-game that challenges you to raise planets' viability levels by establishing outposts and completing other quests. You can also hunt for "memory triggers" left by your father that eventually reveal a few interesting secrets. And then there's mining, which uses a hot/cold indicator to let you hunt for crafting resources while driving across the worlds; space travel, which lets you jump from to location to location, scanning planets for XP; and strike teams, which give you the option to send unseen groups of soldiers out on missions or earn additional rewards by jumping into a cooperative multiplayer horde mode match. Individually, these elements don't add much, but collectively, they do round out the sci-fi fantasy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/3199161-masseffectandromeda_february-19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3199161" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1920px"><a href="https://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/3199161-masseffectandromeda_february-19.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/3199161-masseffectandromeda_february-19.jpg" srcset="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/3199161-masseffectandromeda_february-19.jpg 1920w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1365/13658182/3199161-masseffectandromeda_february-19.jpg 1280w, https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1365/13658182/3199161-masseffectandromeda_february-19.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, there's a dark cloud hanging over all of this: technical issues. Sure, the facial animations really don't look great, but the problems run deeper. On PS4, the framerate was all over the place both in and out of action. On both PS4 and PC, I encountered several audio issues, most notably multiple lines of dialogue playing at the same time, covering each other. I also saw other random glitches like characters that failed to load during conversations, exiting a conversation to find myself a room away from where I was previously, and enemies that fell into the level geometry. None of these issues rendered the game unplayable, but they were noticeable and pervasive.</p><p>In many ways, Andromeda feels like a vision half-fulfilled. It contains a dizzying amount of content, but the quality fluctuates wildly. Its worlds and combat shine, but its writing and missions falter--and the relative strength of the former is not enough to compensate for the inescapable weakness of the latter. As a Mass Effect game, Andromeda falls well short of the nuanced politics, morality, and storytelling of its predecessors. For me, the series has always been about compelling characters and harrowing choices, so to find such weak writing here is bitterly disappointing. Yet even after 65 hours, I still plan on completing a few more quests. The game can't escape its shortcomings, but patient explorers can still find a few stars shining in the darkness.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">1900-6416638</guid><dc:creator>Scott Butterworth</dc:creator><media:content url="https://static.gamespot.com/uploads/screen_medium/1560/15603561/3209119-mass-effect-andromeda-review-thumb-nologo.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><type></type><category></category></item>
